      <p>"Cooperation:
People scoring high on cooperation are more likely to avoid confrontation. They are perfectly willing to compromise or to deny their own needs to get along with others.

Orderliness:
The higher this score, the more tidy, neat, organized the person is.

Dutifulness:
Those scoring higher on dutifulness are more likely to pay their bills on time, and have a higher sense of moral obligation in general.

Energy Level:
Less active people, scoring lower on this scale, tend to appreciate more relaxed pace in life. The higher scorers would enjoy a fast-paced busy schedule.

Gregariousness:
This is  an individualâ€™s measure of desire to be around people. The lower-scorers would be perfectly ok alone, while higher-scorers will seek out frequent communication on a regular basis.

Anger/Fiery:
It takes a lot to make a person angry if they score low on this scale. On the opposite side of the spectrum, it takes little to make a high-scorer angry

Depression Susceptibility:
Low-scorers are more content with their surroundings, while high-scorers tend to be more melancholic.

Liberalism-Conservatism:
On this continuum, extreme liberalism is represented at 0, while extreme conservatism is equivalent to 100. Lower scorers would have readiness to challenge authority, convention, and traditional values."
